# Euclidean geometry

Domains appearing in geometry are an important special case. A small number of
primitive domains are implemented.

## Intervals

DomainSets uses [IntervalSets.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/IntervalSets.jl)
for the definition and manipulation of intervals. Most notably intervals can be
easily created using the ellipsis notation `a..b`.

IntervalSets supports open and closed intervals, finite and infinite intervals,
and intervals of non-numeric types such as dates and times. See the documentation
of the package for the full interface.
