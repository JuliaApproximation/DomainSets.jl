# DomainSets.jl

DomainSets.jl is a package designed to represent simple infinite sets. The package makes it easy to represent sets, verify membership of the set, compare sets and construct new sets from existing ones. Domains are considered equivalent if they describe the same set, regardless of their type.

Get started quickly by looking at the [Examples](@ref).

## What is a domain?

A domain is a continuous set of elements. Typical examples are geometrical
shapes such as cubes and triangles, see [Euclidean geometry](@ref). One can
construct new sets from existing ones as unions and intersections, see [Set operations](@ref). Domains can be combined this way regardless of their types,
see [The domain interface](@ref).
